# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Day 13)

This is **Day 13** of the project-based journey where we are building a **Library Management System in C++** step by step.  

On Day 12, we created the basic skeleton with multiple files (`main.cpp`, `book.cpp`, and `book.h`) to organize the project.  
For Day 13, we **improved functionality and code style**:

### âœ… What's New Today
- Added **consistent and professional input prompts** (all with `:` at the end).
- Enhanced **search output formatting** (clean label alignment).
- Ensured smooth **add, view, search, and delete** book operations.
- Made the code **cleaner and more readable**.
